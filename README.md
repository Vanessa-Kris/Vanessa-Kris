### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Vanessa Christopher (she/ her), originally from Nigeria. I'm just a web developer for now, but definitely will be more before the year runs out.

I was an intern with [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and worked with the NeuroFedora team. It was really a life-changing experience. 
I'm still contributing to open source as a packager at [fedora](https://getfedora.org/). I would also love to contribute to more projects. You could recommend some ðŸ™‚

looking for help with javascript though, I'm finding it really hard ðŸ¥º
